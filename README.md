# Azure-Based Honeypot Deployment

## üìå Project Overview
This project involved deploying a cloud-based honeypot using Microsoft Azure to simulate a vulnerable environment for observing and analyzing cyberattack behaviors. It focused on collecting real-time threat intelligence, detecting brute-force attempts, and visualizing attack patterns using Microsoft Sentinel and Log Analytics.

---

## üéØ Objectives
- Deploy a high-interaction honeypot to attract and monitor cyber threats.
- Collect and analyze logs from the honeypot system.
- Detect malicious activity using KQL queries in Microsoft Sentinel.
- Build dashboards for visualizing attack trends and indicators of compromise (IOCs).

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Tools Used
### Azure Resources
- Virtual Machine: Windows 10 Pro VM (B-series size)
- Virtual Network (VNet): Custom virtual network with internet access
- Network Security Group (NSG): All inbound and outbound ports allowed (intentionally misconfigured to attract attacks)
- Log Analytics Workspace: For centralized logging and data ingestion
- Microsoft Sentinel: SIEM solution connected to the workspace for analysis, rule creation, and visualization

## üîß Setup Steps
### VM Deployment
- Deployed a Windows 10 VM from Azure Marketplace.
- Assigned a public IP to allow unrestricted internet access.


### Networking
- Created a dedicated Virtual Network and Subnet.
- Associated a custom Network Security Group (NSG) with rules (Any protocol, any port, any source):
  - Inbound: Allow All 
  - Outbound: Allow All

### Honeypot Configuration
- Windows Firewall Disabled: To remove local defense mechanisms and allow unrestricted access.


### Log Analytics & Sentinel
- Created a Log Analytics Workspace and connected the VM.
- Enabled data collection for:
  - Security events
  - Audit logs
  - Network traffic
- Integrated Microsoft Sentinel with the workspace.
- Enabled default analytics rules and created custom KQL queries for brute-force detection.

## üß™ Threat Detection & Analysis

### KQL Query Used:
```kql
SecurityEvent
| where Task == 12544
| where EventID in (4624, 4625, 4768, 4769, 4776)
| extend LoginStatus = iff(EventID == 4624 or EventID == 4769 or EventID == 4776, "Success", "Failure")
| summarize
    TotalAttempts = count(),
    SuccessfulLogins = countif(LoginStatus == "Success"),
    FailedLogins = countif(LoginStatus == "Failure"),
    UniqueAccountsAttempted = dcount(Account),
    AccountsAttempted = make_set(Account),
    FirstAttempt = min(TimeGenerated),
    LastAttempt = max(TimeGenerated)
    by IP = IpAddress
| extend SuccessRate = todouble(SuccessfulLogins) / todouble(TotalAttempts) * 100
| project
    IP,
    TotalAttempts,
    SuccessfulLogins,
    FailedLogins,
    SuccessRate = round(SuccessRate, 2),
    UniqueAccountsAttempted,
    AccountsAttempted,
    FirstAttempt,
    LastAttempt
| sort by TotalAttempts desc
```

### MITRE ATT&CK Mapping
- Techniques Detected:
  - T1110 - Brute Force
  - T1078 - Valid Accounts
  - T1133 - External Remote Services
---

## üìä Dashboards Built
- Top Attacking IPs
- Failed Login Attempts Over Time

## üìà Results

- Detected frequent brute-force login attempts from international IPs.
- Identified trends in attacker behavior, including:
  - Time-of-day attack patterns
  - Preferred usernames (e.g., admin, test, adminstartor)

## üìù Conclusion
This honeypot project successfully demonstrated how to deploy a vulnerable Azure environment, monitor real-world cyberattacks, and extract valuable threat intelligence using Microsoft Sentinel. It strengthened practical skills in cloud security monitoring, incident analysis, and SIEM operations.
